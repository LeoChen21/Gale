The purpose of this project is to create a way to voice interface with chatgpt or other apps without having them on the same screen. 
The goal is to optimize workflows without creating additional visible elements.

After cloning this project, you will have to add a file called secretkey.txt to the outermost folder with your personal OpenAI API key and no whitespaces.
Check out this website for more instructions on the API key: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication
